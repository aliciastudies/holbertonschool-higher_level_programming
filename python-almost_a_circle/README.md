## What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project

A test that focuses on components of a software product. The purpose is to ensure  that each unit of software code works as expected. A unit can be a function, method, module, object in an application's source code.

The objective of a unit test is to test an entity in the code to ensure that there are no errors and that it returns the expected output for all relevant inputs.

`assertEqual(a, b)` checks that `a == b`
If the values do not compare equal, the test will fail.
